# Domain Name System (DNS)

A Domain Name System (DNS) **translates a domain name** such as www.example.com **to an IP address**.

**DNS is hierarchical**, with a few **authoritative servers at the top level**.

Your **router or ISP** provides information about **which DNS server(s) to contact** when doing a **lookup**. 

Lower level DNS servers **cache mappings**, which could become **stale** due to DNS propagation delays. 

DNS results can also be **cached by your browser** or OS for a certain period of time, determined by the **time to live (TTL)**.

- **NS record (name server)** - Specifies the DNS servers for you domain/subdomain. 

- **MX record (mail exchange)** - Specifies the mail servers for accepting messages. 

- **A record (address)** - Points a name to an **IP** address. 

- **CNAME (canonical)** - Points a name to another name or **CNAME** (_example.com_ to _www.example.com_) or to an **A** record. 


Services such as **CloudFlare** and **Route 53** provide managed DNS services.  

Some DNS services can **route traffic** through various methods: 

1. **Weighted Round Robin** 
    - Prevent traffic from going to servers under maintenance 
    - Balance between varying cluster sizes. 
    - A/B testing. 

2. **Latency-Based** 
    - If your application is hosted in multiple Regions, you can improve performance for your users by serving their requests from the **Region that provides the lowest latency**.

    - To use latency-based routing, you **create latency records for your resources** in multiple Regions.

3. **Geolocation-Based**
    - Geolocation routing lets you choose the resources that **serve your traffic based on the geographic location of your users**, meaning the location that DNS queries originate from.
    
    - Example, you might want all queries from Europe to be routed to an ELB load balancer in the Frankfurt region.


## Disadvantages (DNS): 

- Accessing a DNS server **introduces a slight delay**, although **mitigated by caching** (described above.)

- DNS server management could be complex and is generally managed by **governments, ISPs, and large companies**. 

- DNS services have recently come under **DDoS attack**, preventing users from accessing websites such as Twitter without knowing Twitter's IP address(es).


### DDoS Attacks: 

- Distributed Network Attacks are often referred to as **Distributed Denial of Service** (DDoS) attacks.

- This type of attack **takes advantage of the specific capacity limits** that apply to any network resources

- The DDoS attack will **send multiple requests** to the attacked web resource – with the **aim of exceeding the website’s capacity** to handle multiple request, and **prevent the website from functioning correctly**.
