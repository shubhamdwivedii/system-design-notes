# Content Delivery Network (CDN)

A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a **globally distributed network of proxy servers**, serving content from **locations closer to the user**.

Generally, **static files** such as **HTML/CSS/JS, photos, and videos** are served from **CDN**

Although some CDNs such as **Amazon's CloudFront** support **dynamic content**. 

The site's **DNS resolutions** will tell clients which servers to contact. 

Serving content from CDNs can significantly improve performance in two ways:
    - Users receive content from data centers close to them
    - Your servers do not have to serve requests that the CDN fulfills


### Push CDNs 

- Push CDNs **receive new content whenever changes occur on your server**.

- You take **full responsibility for providing content**, uploading directly to the CDN and rewriting URLs to point to the CDN.
