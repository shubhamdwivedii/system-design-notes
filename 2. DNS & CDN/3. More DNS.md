# Domain Name System (DNS)

### DNS translates human readable domain names (for example www.amazon.com) to machine readable IP addresses (for example 192.0.2.44)


## DNS Basics 

All computers on the Internet, from your smart phone or laptop to the servers that serve content for massive retail websites, find and communicate with one another by using numbers. **These numbers are known as IP addresses**.

When you open a web browser and go to a website, you don't have to remember and enter a long number. Instead, **you can enter a domain name like example.com** and still end up in the right place.

The Internet’s DNS system works much like a phone book by managing the mapping between names and numbers. 

**DNS servers translate requests for names into IP addresses**, controlling **which server an end user will reach when they type a domain name into their web browser**. These requests are called **queries**.


## Types of DNS Service

### Authoritative DNS: 

**An authoritative DNS service provides an update mechanism that developers use to manage their public DNS names**. 

It then answers DNS queries, translating domain names into IP address so computers can communicate with each other.

**Authoritative DNS has the final authority over a domain and is responsible for providing answers to recursive DNS servers with the IP address information**. 

**Amazon Route 53** is an authoritative DNS system.

### Recursive DNS: 

**Clients typically do not make queries directly to authoritative DNS services**. 

**Instead, they generally connect to another type of DNS service known a resolver, or a recursive DNS service**. 

A recursive DNS service **acts like a hotel concierge**: **while it doesn't own any DNS records, it acts as an intermediary who can get the DNS information on your behalf**. 

If a recursive DNS has the DNS reference **cached, or stored for a period of time**, then it answers the DNS query by providing the source or IP information. 

If not, it passes the query to one or more authoritative DNS servers to find the information.


## How Does DNS Route Traffic To Your Web Application ?

![dns2](./dns_detail.png)

1. A user opens a web browser, enters www.example.com in the address bar, and presses Enter.

2. The request for www.example.com is routed to a **DNS resolver**, which is typically **managed by the user's Internet service provider (ISP)**, such as a **cable Internet provider**, a **DSL broadband provider**, or a **corporate network**.

3. The DNS resolver for the ISP forwards the request for www.example.com to a **DNS root name server**.

4. The DNS resolver for the ISP forwards the request for www.example.com again, this time to one of the **TLD (Top Level Domain) name servers for .com domains**. The name server for .com domains responds to the request with the names of the **four Amazon Route 53 name servers** that are associated with the example.com domain.

5. The DNS resolver for the ISP chooses an Amazon Route 53 name server and forwards the request for www.example.com to that name server.

6. **The Amazon Route 53 name server looks in the example.com hosted zone for the www.example.com record**, gets the associated value, **such as the IP address for a web server, 192.0.2.44**, and returns the IP address to the DNS resolver.

7. **The DNS resolver for the ISP finally has the IP address that the user needs**. The resolver returns that value to the web browser. **The DNS resolver also caches (stores) the IP address for example.com** for an amount of time that you specify so that it can respond more quickly the next time someone browses to example.com. For more information, see **time to live (TTL)**.

8. **The web browser sends a request for www.example.com to the IP address that it got from the DNS resolver**. This is where your content is, for example, a web server running on an Amazon EC2 instance or an Amazon S3 bucket that's configured as a website endpoint.

9. The web server or other resource at 192.0.2.44 returns the web page for www.example.com to the web browser, and the web browser displays the page.

## Servers Pariticipating in DNS 

### 1. ISP 

- **Internet Service Provider**. 

- The company such as AT&T, Verizon, Comcast, Airtel, that provides Internet access to companies, homes and mobile users.

### 2. Root Server 

- **Top of the DNS Hierarchy** 

- **13 Root Servers**, strategically placed around the world by **12 different organizations**

- **Unique IP Address**. 

- **Does not store Domain-IP** but **knows which T.L.D (Top Level Domain) Server to find it**.

- Managing the root server is **ICANN’s** responsibility (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers).

### 3. TLD Name Server 

- A **TLD (Top Level Domain)** nameserver **maintains information for all the domain names that share a common domain extension, such as .com, .net, .org etc**.

- For example, **a .com TLD nameserver contains information for every domain name that ends in ‘.com’**.

- If a web client was querying a resolver for example.com, **after receiving a response from a root nameserver, the recursive resolver would then send a query to a .com TLD nameserver**, which would **respond by providing details about the authoritative nameserver for that domain**.


### 4. Authorative Name Server 

- An **authoritative name server provides original and definitive answers to DNS queries**.

- It does not provide cached answers that were obtained from another name server, on the contrary, **it stores the DNS records in its system and only returns answers to queries about domain names that are stored in its configuration system**.


### 5. Hosting Server 

- A hosting server is a generic term for a type of **server that hosts or houses websites and/or related data, applications and services**.

- **It is a remotely accessible Internet server with complete Web server functionality and resources**.

- A hosting server is also known as a **Web hosting server**.
