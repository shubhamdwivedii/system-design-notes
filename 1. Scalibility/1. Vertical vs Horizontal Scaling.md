# Vertical vs Horizontal Scaling


- Vertical/Horizontal Scaling (Bigger Machine/More Machines)
        Vertical - Buying bigger machine to handle increased traffic. 

        Horizontal - Buying multiple machines to run copy of service to divide increased traffic. 

        Vertical - single point of failure (Horizontal is resilient, if machine is down request is redirected to another instance.)

        Horizontal - load balancing required (Not requried in Vertical. no load to balance)

        Vertical - Interprocess communication (faster)
        Horizonal - Network calls communication (slower) (RPC - remote procedure calls)

        Horizontal - Data inconsistency is issue (can't lock all servers -> loose transactional gurantee)
        Vertical - All data on one site > consistent. 

        Vertical - Hardware limit (can only get bigger to a limit.)
        Horizontal - Scales well as requests increase. 

        Usually a hybrid of vertical/horizontal is used.
