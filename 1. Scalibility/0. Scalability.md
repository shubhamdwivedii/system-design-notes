# Scalability 

### Scalability is the Ability to Handle More Requests. 

When your machine (server) is unable to handle a large traffic of requests, you either buy a bigger machinge (vertical scaling) or buy multiple machines to run another instance of your service (horizontal scaling) to deal with increased traffic.
