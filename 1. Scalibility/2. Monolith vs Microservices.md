# Monolith vs Microservices

- Monoliths are HUGE system (one machine runs entire system) connected directly to client (user). 
- Monoliths are scaled by having multiple machines running same monolith (system)

advantages
- Good for small teams (you cant affort time to break into microservices)
- Lesser moving parts (no need to worry about different parts)
- Less duplication of code across services
- A monolith is faster (no RPC calls) all calls are local withing same application.

disadvantages 
- can be overwhelming for new developer to get familiar with entire system. (lots of context)
- deployments are frequent and complicated. Changes to anything will require deploying whole system. 
- Single point of failure. 
- Whole monolith needs to be scaled (including even that parts that won't usually get much traffic if separate)

- Microservices are multiple system running smaller services (that are interconnected) of which few (or one) is connected to client (user). 
- A microservice is a single business unit. All data all functions which are relevant to a service are put into one microservice. 
- Microservices usually have their own dedicated databases. 
- Clients(users) are usually connected to a "gateway" and this gateway is talking to the microservices.

advantages 
- Easier to scale 
- New developers can be assigned only a particular service. 
- Parallel development is easy. (one team can work on one microservice while other team works on other microservice independently)
- It is easier to identify what is being used less and what is more. Thus: 
- You can identify scale specific microservices (eg. If you can see chat is getting more requests you can scale only the chat microservice to more servers)


disadvantages 
- Not easy to design (sometimes we break some services into a separate microservice when it shouldn't be a microservice. eg breking chat furthuer into two microservices.)
    - To identify see if a service S1 is only communicating with a service S2. This implies S1 should better be a part of S2 rather than a separate microservice.
