# High Level Trade-Offs

### Keep in mind that Everything is a Trade-Off. 

#### There are three kinds of trade-offs 

1. **Performance** vs **Scalability** 
2. **Latency** vs **Throughput** 
3. **Availability** vs **Consistency**


### 1. Performance vs Scalability 

- A service is **scalable** if it results in increased **performance** in a manner **proportional to resources added**. 

- Generally, **increasing performance** means **serving more units of work**, but it can also be to **handle larger units of work**, such as **when datasets grow**.

#### Another way to look at performance vs scalability: 

- If you have a **performance problem**, your system is **slow for a single user**. 

- If you have a **scalability problem**, your system is **fast for a single user** but **slow under heavy load** (ie: many users). 


### 2. Latency vs Throughtput 

- **Latency** is the **time** to **perform some action** or to **produce some result**.

- **Throughput** is the **number of such actions** or **results per unit of time**. 

- Generally, you should aim for **maximum throughput** with **acceptable latency**. 


### 3. Availability vs Consistency 

- In a **distrubuted computer system**, you can olly support two of the following gurantees: 
    
    1. **Consistency** - Every read receives the **most recent write or an error**. 

    2. **Availability** - Every request receives a response, **without guarantee** that it constains the most recent version of the information.

    3. **Partition Tolerance** - The system **continues to operate despite** arbitrary **partitioning dues to network failures**. 

- You can either have **CP** or **AP**.
 
- **AP** is a good choice if the business needs allow for **eventual consisteny** or when system needs to continue **working despite external errors**.
