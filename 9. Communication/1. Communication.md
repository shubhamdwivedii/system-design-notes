# Communication 


## The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model (7 Layers)

## Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)

**HTTP is a method for encoding and transporting data between a client and a server**. 

**It is a request/response protocol:**

**Clients issue requests** and **server issue responses** with relevant content and completion status info about the request. 

HTTP is self-contained, allowing requests and responses to **flow through many intermediate routers and servers that perform load balancing, caching, encryption, and compression**. 

A basic HTTP request consists of a **verb (method)** and a **resource (endpoint)**. 

_See Common HTTP Verbs (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)_


**_HTTP_ is an application layer protocol relying on lower-level protocols such as _TCP_ and _UDP_**.


## Transimssion Control Protocol (TCP)

**TCP is a connection-oriented protocol over an IP Network**. 

Connection is established and terminated using a **handshake**. 

![comm2](./comm_tcp.jpg)


**All packets send are guaranteed to reach the destination in the original order and without corruption through**:

- Sequence numbers and **checksum fields** for each packet. 
- **Acknowledgement** packets and automatic retransmission. 

If the sender does not receive a correct response, it will resend the packets. If there are multiple timeouts, the connection is dropped. 

TCP also implements **flow control** and **congestion control**. These guarantees cause delays and generally result in less efficient transmission than UDP.

To ensure high throughput, web servers can keep a large number of TCP connections open, resulting in high memory usage.

It can be expensive to have a large number of open connections between web server threads and say, a memcached server. 

**Connection pooling** can help in addition to switching to UDP where applicable.

**TCP is useful for applications that require high reliability but are less time critical**. 

Some examples include **web servers, database info, SMTP, FTP, and SSH**.


**Use TCP over UDP when**:

- **You need all of the data to arrive intact**.
- **You want to automatically make a best estimate use of the network throughput**.


## User Datagram Protocol (UDP)


**UDP is connectionless**. 

**Datagrams (analogous to packets) are guaranteed only at the datagram level**. 

![comm3](./comm_udp.jpg)

Datagrams might reach their destination **out of order or not at all**.

**UDP does not support congestion control**. 
 
Without the guarantees that TCP support, **UDP is generally more efficient**.

**UDP can broadcast, sending datagrams to all devices on the subnet**. 

This is useful with DHCP because the client has not yet received an IP address, thus preventing a way for TCP to stream without the IP address.


UDP is less reliable but works well in real time use cases such as **VoIP, video chat, streaming, and realtime multiplayer games**.


**Use UDP over TCP when**:

- **You need the lowest latency**
- **Late data is worse than loss of data**
- **You want to implement your own error correction**


## Remote Procedure Call (RPC)

**In an RPC, a client causes a procedure to execute on a different address space, usually a remote server**. 

![comm4](./comm_rpc.png)

**The procedure is coded as if it were a local procedure call**, **abstracting awaay the details of how to communicate with the server from the client program**.

Remote calls are usually **slower and less reliable than local calls** so it is helpful to distinguish RPC calls from local calls. 

Popular RPC frameworks include **Protobuf**, **Thrift**, and **Avro**.


**RPC is a request-response protocol**: 

- **Client program** - Calls the client stub procedure. The parameters are pushed onto the stack like a local procedure call.

- **Client stub procedure** - Marshals (packs) procedure id and arguments into a request message.

- **Client communication module** - OS sends the message from the client to the server.

- **Server communication module** - OS passes the incoming packets to the server stub procedure.

- **Server stub procedure** - Unmarshalls the results, calls the server procedure matching the procedure id and passes the given arguments.

- The server response repeats the steps above in reverse order.


Sample RPC Calls: 

```curl 
GET /someoperation?data=anId

POST /anotheroperation
{
  "data":"anId";
  "anotherdata": "another value"
}
``` 

**RPC is focused on exposing behaviors**. 

RPCs are often used for performance reasons with internal communications, as you can hand-craft native calls to better fit your use cases.


### Disadvantages (RPC)

- **RPC clients become tightly coupled to the service implementation**.

- **A new API must be defined for every new operation or use case**.

- **It can be difficult to debug RPC**.

- **You might not be able to leverage existing technologies out of the box**. For example, it might require additional effort to ensure RPC calls are properly cached on caching servers such as **Squid**.


## Representational State Transfer (REST)

**REST is an architectural style enforcing a client/server model where the client acts on a set of resources managed by the server**.

The server provides a representation of resources and actions that can either manipulate or get a new representation of resources.

**All communication must be stateless and cacheable**.


There are four qualities of a RESTful interface:

- **Identify resources (URI in HTTP)** - use the same URI regardless of any operation.

- **Change with representations (Verbs in HTTP)** - use verbs, headers, and body.

- **Self-descriptive error message (status response in HTTP)** - Use status codes, don't reinvent the wheel.

- **HATEOAS (HTML interface for HTTP)** - your web service should be fully accessible in a browser.

Sample REST calls:

```curl
GET /someresources/anId

PUT /someresources/anId
{"anotherdata": "another value"}
```

**REST is focused on exposing data**. 

**It minimizes the coupling between client/server and is often used for public HTTP APIs**. 

REST uses a more generic and uniform method of exposing resources through URIs, representation through headers, and actions through verbs such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH. 

**Being stateless, REST is great for horizontal scaling and partitioning**.


### Disadvantages (REST)

- **With REST being focused on exposing data, it might not be a good fit if resources are not naturally organized or accessed in a simple hierarchy**. 
    - For example, returning all updated records from the past hour matching a particular set of events is not easily expressed as a path. With REST, it is likely to be implemented with a combination of URI path, query parameters, and possibly the request body.

- **REST typically relies on a few verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH) which sometimes doesn't fit your use case**. 
    - For example, moving expired documents to the archive folder might not cleanly fit within these verbs.

- **Fetching complicated resources with nested hierarchies requires multiple round trips between the client and server to render single views**, e.g. fetching content of a blog entry and the comments on that entry. 
    - For mobile applications operating in variable network conditions, these multiple roundtrips are highly undesirable.

- Over time, more fields might be added to an API response and older clients will receive all new data fields, even those that they do not need, as a result, it bloats the payload size and leads to larger latencies.
