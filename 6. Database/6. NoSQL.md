# NoSQL 

NoSQL is a **collection of data items** represented in a **key-value store**, **document store**, **wide column store** or a **graph database**.  

Data is **denormalized** and **joins are generally done in application code**. 

Most NoSQL stores lack true **ACID** transactions and favor **Eventual Consitency**. 

**BASE** is often used to describe the properties of NoSQL databases. 

In comparison to **CAP Theorem**, **BASE** chooses availability over consistency. 

- **Basically Available** - The system guarantees availability. 
- **Soft State** - The state of the system may change over time, even without input. 
- **Eventual Consitency** - The system will become consistent over a period of time, given that the system doesn't receive input during that period. 


## Types of NoSQL Database: 

### 1. Key-Value Store 

**Abstraction: Hash Table** 

A key-value store generally allows for **O(1) reads and writes** and is often **backed by memory or SSD**. 

Data stores can maintain keys in **lexicographic order**, allowing efficient retrieval of key ranges.  

Key-value stores can allow for **storing of metadata with a value**.

Key-value stores **provide high performance** and are **often used for simple data models** or for **rapidly-changing data**, such as in-memory cache layer. 

Since they offer only a limited set of operations, **complexity is shifted to the application layer** if additional operations are needed. 

A key-value store is the basis for more complex systems such as a document store, and in some cases, a graph database. 


### 2. Document Store

**Abstraction: key-value store with documents stored as values.** 

A document store is centered around documents (XML, JSON, binary, etc) where **a document stores all information for a given object**. Document stores **provide APIs or a query language** to query based on the internal structure of the document itself. 

_NOTE, many key-value stores include features for working with a value's metadata, blurring the lines between these two storage types._ 

Based on the underlying implementation, **documents are organized by collections, tags, metadata, or directories**. 

Although documents can be organized or grouped together, documents may have fields that are completely different from each other. 

Some document stores like **MongoDB** and **CouchDB** also provide a SQL-like language to perform complex queries. **DynamoDB** supports both key-values and documents. 

Document stores provide high flexibility and are often used for working with occationally changing data. 



### 3. Wide Column Store

**Abstraction: Nested map**

A wide column store's basic unit of data is a column (name/value pair).

A column can be grouped in column families (analogous to a SQL table). 

Super column families further group column families. 

You can access each column independently with a row key, and columns with the same row key form a row. 

Each value contains a timestamp for versioning and for conflict resolution.

Google introduced **Bigtable** as the first wide column store, which influenced the open-source **HBase** often-used in the Hadoop ecosystem, and **Cassandra** from Facebook. 

Stores such as BigTable, HBase, and Cassandra maintain **keys in lexicographic order, allowing efficient retrieval** of selective key ranges.

Wide column stores offer **high availability and high scalability**. They are often used for **very large data sets**.


### 4. Graph Database 

**Abstraction: Graph**

In a graph database, **each node is a record and each arc is a relationship between two nodes**. 

Graph databases are optimized to represent complex relationships with many foreign keys or **many-to-many relationships**.

Graphs databases offer **high performance for data models with complex relationships, such as a social network**. 

They are relatively new and are not yet widely-used; it might be more difficult to find development tools and resources. 

Many graphs can only be accessed with REST APIs.
