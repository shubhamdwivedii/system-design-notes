# SQL or NoSQL


![db8](./db_sql_vs_nosql.png)


### Reasons for SQL: 

1. Structured data 
2. Strict schema 
3. Relational data ?
4. Need for complex joins 
5. Transactions 
6. Clear patterns for scaling 
7. More established: developers, community, code, tools, etc. 
8. Lookups by index are very fast. 


### Reasons for NoSQL: 

1. Semi-structured data 
2. Dynamic or flexible schema 
3. Non-relational data 
4. No need for complex joins 
5. Store many TB (or PB) of data 
6. Very data intensive workload 
7. Very high throughput for IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Seconds)

### Sample data well-suited for NoSQL: 

1. Rapid ingest of clickstream and log data 
2. Leaderboard or scoring data 
3. Temporary data, such as a shopping cart 
4. Frequently accessed ('hot') tables 
5. Metadata/lookup tables


**An SQL Database provides these three benefits:** 

1. Mutability - Rows can be modified (in NoSQL entire documents need to be updated sometimes)
2. Trasaction - SQL provides transactional guarantee 
3. Indexes - To improve search capabilities. 
4. Access Control - can be also achieved in NoSQL or File System. 


### Choose SQL for Relational Data & NoSQL for Object Data: 

**"Relational nature"** for me translates to: all the items of a particular type have pretty much the same attributes, which makes it quite easy to design a simple table, but all items into that table and then SQL to perform CRUD and retrieval. In addition, if your data can be modelled such that all items have one of a limited set of types, you can then define a relational data structure that corresponds to this set of types.

**"Object nature"** translates into: Items of similar type can have a wide variety of attributes, and these attributes can be of a wide variety in nature and type. Very often this could (with sufficient effort) be translated into a relational model, but a lot of the tables would be very sparsely populated and you would end up with very inefficient LEFT OUTER joins, which makes the performance of a relational database sluggish when compared to a NOSQL database.


## Example 

**RDBMS Tables:**

- **One to Many**: City and Theatre
- **One to Many**: Theatre  and Screen
- **One to Many**: Screen and Tier
- **One to Many**: Tier and Seats
- **One to Many**: Screen and Shows 
- **One to One**: Show and Movie
- **One to One**: Seats and Booking


**NoSQL Tables:** 

There will be no relationship between these tables: 

- Comments
- Ratings 
- Movie Information 
- Trailers or Posters 
- Artists 
- Cast and Crews
- Reviews 
- Analytics Data
