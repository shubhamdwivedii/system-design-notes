# SQL or NoSQL


![db8](./db_sql_vs_nosql.png)


### Reasons for SQL: 

1. Structured data 
2. Strict schema 
3. Relational data ?
4. Need for complex joins 
5. Transactions 
6. Clear patterns for scaling 
7. More established: developers, community, code, tools, etc. 
8. Lookups by index are very fast. 


### Reasons for NoSQL: 

1. Semi-structured data 
2. Dynamic or flexible schema 
3. Non-relational data 
4. No need for complex joins 
5. Store many TB (or PB) of data 
6. Very data intensive workload 
7. Very high throughput for IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Seconds)

### Sample data well-suited for NoSQL: 

1. Rapid ingest of clickstream and log data 
2. Leaderboard or scoring data 
3. Temporary data, such as a shopping cart 
4. Frequently accessed ('hot') tables 
5. Metadata/lookup tables
