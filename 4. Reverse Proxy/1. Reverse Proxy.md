# Reverse Proxy (Web Server)

A Reverse Proxy is a **Web Server** that **centralizes internal services** and **provides unified interfaces to the public**. 

**Request from clients are forwared** (by reverse-proxy server) to a server that can fulfill it before the reverse proxy returns the server's response to the client.

Additional benefits include: 

1. **Increased Security** - Hide information about backend servers, Blacklist IPs, Limit number of connections per client (**Rate Limiter**)

2. **Increased Scalability and Flexibility** - CLients only see the reverse proxy's IP, allowing you to scale servers or change their configuration. 

3. **SSL Termination** - Decrypt incoming requests and encrypt server responses so backend servers do no have to perfrom these potentially expensive operations. 
    
4. **Compression** - Compress server responses.

5. **Caching** - Return the resonse for cached requests. 

6. **Static Content** - Serve static content directly 
    - HTML/CSS/JS 
    - Photos
    - Videos


### Load Balancer vs Reverse Proxy 

- Deploying a **load balancer is useful when you have multiple servers**. Often, load balancers route traffic to set of servers serving the same function. 

- **Reverse proxies can be useful even with just one web server**, opening up the benefits described above. 

- **NGINX** and **HAProxy** can support both **layer 7 reverse proxying and load balancing**. 


### Disadvantages (Reverse Proxy)

- Introducing reverse proxy results in **increased complexity**. 

- A **single reverse proxy** is a **single point of failure**, configuring **multiple reverse proxies** (ie: a **failover**) furthur **increases complexity**.
