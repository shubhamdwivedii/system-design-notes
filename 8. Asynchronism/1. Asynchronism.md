# Asynchronism 

**Asynchronous workflows help reduce times for expensive operations that would otherwise be performed in-line**.

They can also help by doing time-consuming work in advance, such as periodic aggregation of data. 


## Message Queues 

Message queues **receive, hold, and deliver messages**.

If an operation is too slow to perform inline, you can use a message queue with the following workflow: 

1. **An application publishes a job to the queue, then notifies the user of job status**. 

2. **A worker picks up the job from the queue, processes it, then signals the job is complete**. 

The user is **not blocked** and the job is **processed in the background**. 

During this time, the client might optionally do a small amount of processing to make it seem like the task has completed. 

For example: if posting a **tweet**, the tweet could be instantly posted to your timeline, but it could take some time before your tweet is actually delivered to all of your followers. 

**Redis** is useful as a simple message broker but messages can be lost. 

**RabbitMQ** is popular but requires you to adapt to the 'AMQP' protocol and manage your own nodes. 

**Amazon SQS** is hosted but can have high latency and has the possibility of messages being delivered twice. 


## Task Queues 

Task queues **receive tasks and their related data, runs them, then delivers thier result**. 

They can support scheduling and can be used to run computationally intensive jobs in the background. 

**Celery** has support for scheduling and primarily has python support. 


## Back Pressure 

**If queues start to grow significantly, the queue size can become larger than memory, resulting in cache misses, disk reads, and even slower performance**. 

**Back Pressure** can help by **limiting the queue size, thereby maintaining a high throughput rate and good response times for jobs already in the queue**. 

Once the queue fills up, clients get a server busy or HTTP 503 status code to try again later. 

Clients can retry the request at a later time, perhaps with exponential backoff. 


## Disadvantages (Asynchronism)

- Use cases such as inexpensive calculations and realtime workflows might better suited for synchronous operations, as introducting queues can add delays and complexity.
