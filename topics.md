1. Scalability (Being able to handle more requests)
    - Vertical vs Horizontal Scaling 
    - Monolith vs Microservice
    - Caching 
    - Load Balancing (requried in Horizontal scaling)
    - Database Replication 
    - Database Partitioning and Sharding


Furthur topics 

Horizontal vs Vertical in More Detail + Tradeoffs. 

DNS CDN Reverse Proxy in more detail.

Load balancer layer 4 and layer 7 

Hashing and Hashing functions Base 62,64, MD5, sha256 

Rate Limiter 


Remote Procedure Calls (in more detail RPC (gRPC))

SaaS PaaS etc. 

Object Store 

SQL in general. indexing in SQL 

What is RDBMS ?? What is relational data ? (what is indexing?)

SQL vs NoSQL tradeoffs why and when to use which ?

How denormalization is done (in practise)

Caching algos eg. least recently used LRU


Some term definiation such as "Latency" and "Consitency"


cache invalidation.

redundancy and availability (highly available?)

Examples of each:   
    - Load Balancer - Amazon ELB, HAProxy 
    - CDN - CloudFront 
    - Cache - Redis 
    - Message Queues - RabbitMQ
    - MemoryCache - AWS ElastiCache, Memcached ?
