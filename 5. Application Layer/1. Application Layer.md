# Application Layer 

![applr1](./app_layer.png)


**Separating** out the **Web Layer** from the **Application Layer (aka Platform Layer)** allows you to **scale and configure both layers independently**

**Adding a new API results in adding Application Servers without necessarily adding additional Web Servers**. 

The **Single Responsibility Principle** advocates for **small and autonomous services that work together**. 

Small teams with small services can plan more aggressively for rapid growth. 

**Workers in the Application Layer also help enable asynchronism**. 


### Microservices 

A **microservice** architecture is a variant of the **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)** structual style. 

It **arranges** an application as **a collection of loosely-coupled services**. 

Microservices can be described as **a suite of independently deployable, small, modular services**. 

Each service runs a unique process and communicates through a well-defined, lightweight mechanism to serve business goal.

### Service Discovery 

Systems such as **Consul**, **Etcd**, and **Zookeeper** can help services find each other **by keeping track of registered names, addresses and ports**. 

**Health Checks** help verify service integrity and are often done using an **HTTP** endpoint. 

Both **Consul** and **Etcd** have built in **key-value store** that can be userful for storing config values and other shared data. 


### Disadvantages (Application Layer)

- Adding an application layer with **loosely coupled services** _requires a different approach_ from an **architectural, operations, and process** viewpoint (**vs a monolithic system**)

- Microservices can add **complexity in terms of deployments and operations**.
