# Design the Twitter (or Facebook) timeline and search 

## Step 1: Outline use cases and constraints 

### Use Cases: 

**We'll scope the problem to handle only the following use cases:**

- **User** posts a tweet 
    - **Service** pushes tweets to followers, sending push notifications and emails 

- **User** views the user timeline (activity from the user)

- **User** views the home timeline (activity from the prople the user is following)

- **User** searches keywords 

- **Service** has **high availability**

Out of scope
- **Service** pushes tweets to the Twitter Firehose and other streams

- **Service** strips out tweets based on users' visibility settings
    - Hide @reply if the user is not also following the person being replied to
    - Respect 'hide retweets' setting

- **Analytics**


### Constraints and Assumptions: 

#### State Assumptions:

**General:**

- Traffic is not evenly distributed
- Posting a tweet should be fast
    - Fanning out a tweet to all of your followers should be fast, unless you have millions of followers
- 100 million active users
- 500 million tweets per day or 15 billion tweets per month
    - Each tweet averages a fanout of 10 deliveries
    - 5 billion total tweets delivered on fanout per day
    - 150 billion tweets delivered on fanout per month
- 250 billion read requests per month
- 10 billion searches per month

**Timeline:**

- Viewing the timeline should be fast
- Twitter is more read heavy than write heavy
    - Optimize for fast reads of tweets
- Ingesting tweets is write heavy

**Search**

- Searching should be fast
- Search is read-heavy

## Step 2: Create a high level design

## Step 3: Design core components 

**Dive into details for each core component.**

### Use Case: User posts a tweet 

We could store the **user's own tweets** to populate the user timeline (activity from the user) in a **relational database**. 

We should discuss the **use cases and tradeoffs choosing SQL or NoSQL**. 

Delivering tweets and building the home timeline (activity from people the user is following) is trickier. 

**Fanning out** tweets to all followers (60 thousand tweets delivered on **fanout per second**) will overload a traditional **relational database**. 

We'll probably want to choose a data store with fast writes such as a **NoSQL database** or **Memory Cache**. 

Reading 1 MB sequentially from memory takes about 250 microseconds, while reading from SSD takes 4x and drom Disk takes 80x longer. 

We could store media such as photos or videos on an **Object Store**. 


- The **Client** posts a tweet to the **Web Server**, running as a **Reverse Proxy**. 

- The **Web Server** forwards the request to the **Write API** server. 

- The **Write API** stores the tweet in the user's timeline on a **SQL database**. 

- The **Write API** contacts the **Fan Out Service**, which does the following: 

    - Queries the **User Graph Service** to find the user's followers stored in the **Memory Cache**. 

    - Stores the tweet in the *home timeline of the user's followers* in a **Memory Cache**. 
        - O(n) operation: 1000 followers = 1000 lookups and inserts. 
    
    - Stores the tweet in the **Search Index Service** to enable fast searching. 

    - Stores media in the **Object Store**.

    - Uses the **Notification Service** to send out push notifications to followers: 
        - Uses a **Queue** (not pictured) to **asynchronously send out notifications**. 


If our **Memory Cache** is **Redis**, we could use a native **Redis List** with following structure: 

                tweet n+2                   tweet n+1                   tweet n
    | 8 bytes   8 bytes  1 byte | 8 bytes   8 bytes  1 byte | 8 bytes   8 bytes  1 byte |
    | tweet_id  user_id  meta   | tweet_id  user_id  meta   | tweet_id  user_id  meta   |


The new tweet would be placed in the **Memory Cache**, which populates the user's home timeline (activity from people the user is following).


We'll use a public **REST API**:

    $ curl -X POST --data '{ "user_id": "123", "auth_token": "ABC123", \
        "status": "hello world!", "media_ids": "ABC987" }' \
        https://twitter.com/api/v1/tweet


Response: 
```json 
{
    "created_at": "Wed Sep 05 00:37:15 +0000 2012",
    "status": "hello world!",
    "tweet_id": "987",
    "user_id": "123",
    ...
}
``` 


For internal communications, we could use **Remote Procedure Calls**.


### Use Case: User views the home timeline 

- The **Client** posts a home timeline request to the **Web Server**

- The **Web Server** forwards the request to the **Read API** server

- The **Read API** server contacts the **Timeline Service**, which does the following:
    - Gets the timeline data stored in the **Memory Cache**, containing tweet ids and user ids - O(1)
    - Queries the **Tweet Info Service** with a multiget to obtain additional info about the tweet ids - O(n)
    - Queries the **User Info Service** with a multiget to obtain additional info about the user ids - O(n)


REST API:

    $ curl https://twitter.com/api/v1/home_timeline?user_id=123

Response:
```json
{
    "user_id": "456",
    "tweet_id": "123",
    "status": "foo"
},
{
    "user_id": "789",
    "tweet_id": "456",
    "status": "bar"
},
{
    "user_id": "789",
    "tweet_id": "579",
    "status": "baz"
},
```


### Use Case: Use searches keywords 

- The **Client** sends a search request to the **Web Server**

- The **Web Server** forwards the request to the **Search API** server

- The **Search API** contacts the **Search Service**, which does the following:
    - **Parses/tokenizes** the input query, determining what needs to be searched
        - Removes markup
        - Breaks up the text into terms
        - Fixes typos
        - Normalizes capitalization
        - Converts the query to use boolean operations

    - Queries the **Search Cluster** (ie **Lucene**) for the results:
        - Scatter gathers each server in the cluster to determine if there are any results for the query
        - Merges, ranks, sorts, and returns the results


REST API:

    $ curl https://twitter.com/api/v1/search?query=hello+world

The response would be similar to that of the home timeline, except for tweets matching the given query.


## Step 4: Scale the design

![twitter2](./twitter_step4.png)

**Important: Do not simply jump right into the final design from the initial design!**

State you would:
1. **Benchmark/Load Test** 
2. **Profile** for bottlenecks
3. address bottlenecks while evaluating alternatives and trade-offs
4. repeat.


The **Fanout Service is a potential bottleneck**. Twitter users with millions of followers could take several minutes to have their tweets go through the fanout process. This could lead to race conditions with @replies to the tweet, which we could mitigate by re-ordering the tweets at serve time.

We could also avoid fanning out tweets from **highly-followed users**. Instead, we could search to find tweets for highly-followed users, **merge the search results** with the user's home timeline results, then re-order the tweets at serve time.


Additional optimizations include:

- Keep only several hundred tweets for each home timeline in the **Memory Cache**

- Keep only active users' home timeline info in the **Memory Cache**
    - If a user was not previously active in the past 30 days, we could rebuild the timeline from the SQL Database
        - Query the **User Graph Service** to determine who the user is following
        - Get the tweets from the **SQL Database** and add them to the **Memory Cache**

- Store only a month of tweets in the **Tweet Info Service**

- Store only active users in the **User Info Service**

- The **Search Cluster** would likely need to **keep the tweets in memory to keep latency low**


We'll also want to address the bottleneck with the **SQL Database**.

Although the **Memory Cache** should reduce the load on the database, it is unlikely the **SQL Read Replicas** alone would be enough to handle the cache misses. We'll probably need to employ additional SQL scaling patterns.

The high volume of writes would overwhelm a single SQL Write Master-Slave, also pointing to a need for additional scaling techniques.

- **Federation**
- **Sharding**
- **Denormalization**
- **SQL Tuning**

We should also consider moving some data to a **NoSQL Database**.

## What is Fan-Out ?

_Google Fan-out service for social media_

_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAgw6dEiNz8_

_https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan-out_(software)_


In **message-oriented middleware** solutions, **fan-out** is a **messaging pattern used to model an information exchange that implies the delivery (or spreading) of a message to one or multiple destinations possibly in parallel**, and **not halting the process that executes the messaging to wait for any response to that message**.


### What is the “Fanout” Messaging Pattern ? 


Fanout is a messaging design where the **published message from a particular publisher is consumed by multiple different subscribers independently and simultaneously**. 

The intention is that the **same published message will be consumed by different consumers and be processed in different ways**.

In a message broker like **RabbitMQ**, the publisher publishes a message which is put into **different queues** through a special type of exchange called **“Fanout Exchange”**.

Consumers listening to these queues get the same message to be consumed.

### When to Use Fanout Pattern ? 

The use case of fanout pattern is applicable in places where a publisher needs to **asynchronously communicate to multiple consumers on a single workload**.
