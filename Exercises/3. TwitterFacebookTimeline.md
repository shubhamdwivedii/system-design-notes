# Design the Twitter (or Facebook) timeline and search 

## Step 1: Outline use cases and constraints 

### Use Cases: 

**We'll scope the problem to handle only the following use cases:**

- **User** posts a tweet 
    - **Service** pushes tweets to followers, sending push notifications and emails 

- **User** views the user timeline (activity from the user)

- **User** views the home timeline (activity from the prople the user is following)

- **User** searches keywords 

- **Service** has **high availability**

Out of scope
- **Service** pushes tweets to the Twitter Firehose and other streams

- **Service** strips out tweets based on users' visibility settings
    - Hide @reply if the user is not also following the person being replied to
    - Respect 'hide retweets' setting

- **Analytics**


### Constraints and Assumptions: 

#### State Assumptions:

**General:**

- Traffic is not evenly distributed
- Posting a tweet should be fast
    - Fanning out a tweet to all of your followers should be fast, unless you have millions of followers
- 100 million active users
- 500 million tweets per day or 15 billion tweets per month
    - Each tweet averages a fanout of 10 deliveries
    - 5 billion total tweets delivered on fanout per day
    - 150 billion tweets delivered on fanout per month
- 250 billion read requests per month
- 10 billion searches per month

**Timeline:**

- Viewing the timeline should be fast
- Twitter is more read heavy than write heavy
    - Optimize for fast reads of tweets
- Ingesting tweets is write heavy

**Search**

- Searching should be fast
- Search is read-heavy

## Step 2: Create a high level design

## Step 3: Design core components 

**Dive into details for each core component.**

### Use Case: User posts a tweet 

We could store the **user's own tweets** to populate the user timeline (activity from the user) in a **relational database**. 

We should discuss the use cases and tradeoffs choosing SQL or NoSQL.
